Osikov lies at the eastern foot of the Čergov Mountains in the southwestern part of the Bartošov Basin. The oldest known written record of the village comes from a document from 1296 in the form of Osikó, which means that the village existed at least in the middle of the 13th century. Throughout history, it has retained its name almost unchanged - 1372 Osikov, 1808 Ossíková, 1920 Ošikov, 1927 Osikov. In the Middle Ages, it was referred to as Osikó, which we perceive as a Hungarianized form of the name Osikov. This name is most likely derived from the aspen growth along the local stream.

According to available sources, the original settlers originated in the western regions and neighboring Poland, whose estates at that time needed to process wood in the local forests.

Since the 14th century, the village was owned by the Perényi family, who were later succeeded by the Zápoľský, Lobočkí and Forgáč families. In the 16th century, it was part of the Hertník estate.

The dominant feature of the village is the Roman Catholic Church of St. Michael the Archangel from 1612, which was built by Count Žigmund Forgách in the Renaissance style.
